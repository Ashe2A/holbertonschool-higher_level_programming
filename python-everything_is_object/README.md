Test files for tasks wich answers were certain were not created.

## 0. Who am I?

## 1. Where are you?
Python Doc: [CPython implementation detail: For CPython, id(x) is the memory address where x is stored.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html)

## 2. Right count
## 3. Right count =
## 4. Right count =
## 5. Right count =+
## 6. Is equal
## 7. Is the same
## 8. Is really equal
## 9. Is really the same
Identical list comparison should return True, but seems like False is required since they don't share the same address (is Python wrong on this one?)

## 10. And with a list, is it equal

## 11. And with a list, is it the same
Contrary to integers or strings, identical lists are not considered the same object?

## 12. And with a list, is it really equal
## 13. And with a list, is it really the same
## 14. List append
## 15. List add
## 16. Integer incrementation

## 17. List incrementation
Appending an list argument in a method appends the original list?

## 18. List assignation
Poiting a list argument to another list argument doesn't point the original list to the other original list?

## 19. Copy a list object
## 20. Tuple or not?
## 21. Tuple or not?
## 22. Tuple or not?
## 23. Tuple or not?
## 24. Who I am?
## 25. Tuple or not
## 26. Empty is not empty
## 27. Still the same?
## 28. Same or not?
## 29. Python3: Mutable, Immutable... everything is object!
