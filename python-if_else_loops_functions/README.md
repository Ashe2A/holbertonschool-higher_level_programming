## 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
### [`3-print_alphabt.py`](3-print_alphabt.py)
* Prints lowercase alphabet except `q` and `e`, with one loop and neither imports nor variable storage.

## 4. Hexadecimal printing
### [`4-print_hexa.py`](4-print_hexa.py)
* Prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal, with one loop and neither imports nor variable storage.

## 5. 00...99
### [`5-print_comb2.py`](5-print_comb2.py)
* Prints all numbers from `00` to `99` in decimal separated by a comma and followed by a newline. Uses no more than 2 prints with string format, with one loop and neither imports nor variable storage.

## 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
### [`6-print_comb3.py`](6-print_comb3.py)
* Prints all numbers from `01` to `89` in decimal separated by a comma and followed by a newline. Every number must have the first digit greater than the second. Uses no more than 3 prints with string format, with 2 loops and neither imports nor variable storage.

## 7. islower
### [`7-islower.py`](7-islower.py)
* Function that returns whether a character is a lowercase letter without using `str.upper()` or `str.isupper()`, imports or modules.
### [`7-main.py`](7-main.py)
* **Tests:** `a` (lowercase), `H` (uppercase), `A` (uppercase), `3` (other), `g` (lowercase).
    * Note: The main function prints uppercase even for non letter characters, due to only checking lowercase letters.

## 8. To uppercase
### [`8-uppercase.py`](8-uppercase.py)
* Function that turns lowercase letters of a string into uppercase ones, using 2 prints with string format, one loop, and neither `str.upper()` or `str.isupper()`, imports nor modules.
### [`8-main.py`](8-main.py)
* **Tests:** `"best"` (`"BEST"`), `"Best School 98 Battery street"` (`"BEST SCHOOL 98 BATTERY STREET"`)

## 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
### [`9-print_last_digit.py`](9-print_last_digit.py)
* Function that prints the last digit of a number, without imports nor modules.
### [`9-main.py`](9-main.py)
* **Tests:** `98` (`"8"`), `0` (`"0"`), `-1024` (`"4"`)
