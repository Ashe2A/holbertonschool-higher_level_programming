# [Python - Hello World](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/2170)
## 0. Hello, print
### [`2-print.py`](2-print.py)
* Prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line, using the `print()` function.

## 1. Print integer
### [`3-print_number.py`](3-print_number.py)
* Prints the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line. Avoided to cast the variable `number` and writing more than 3 lines, and instead used an f-string.

## 2. Print float
### [`4-print_float.py`](4-print_float.py)
* Prints the float stored in the variable `number`, with a precision of 2 digits. Avoided to cast the variable `number` and instead used an f-string.

## 3. Print string
### [`5-print_string.py`](5-print_string.py)
* Prints 3 times a string stored in the variable `str`, followed by its first 9 characters. Avoided to use loops and conditions, and writing more than 5 lines.

## 4. Play with strings
### [`6-concat.py`](6-concat.py)
* Concats the variables `str1` and `str2` and casts it into a printed string. Avoided to use loops and conditions, and used exactly 5 lines.

## 5. Copy - Cut - Paste
### [`7-edges.py`](7-edges.py)
* Concats the edges of the variable `word` (first, last and mid) and lists these edges. Avoided to use loops and conditions, and used exactly 8 lines.

## 6. Create a new sentence
### [`8-concat_edges.py`](8-concat_edges.py)
* Concats pieces of the variable `str` to print ``object-oriented programming with Python`, followed by a new line. Avoided to use loops and conditions, new variables, string literals (a string value without the variable name), and used exactly 5 lines.
